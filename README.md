Student Information Registration System
Hey there, Welcome to the Student Information Registration System. This README is here to give you an inside look at the features and functions of our web-based application, which is tailored to efficiently collect and store student information.(prettty simple not done yet but shows some skills)

Features
Student Information Form
At the heart of our system is a user-friendly form designed for students to input their essential details. It includes:

Username: can enter thier campus.
Campus: Students can pinpoint their campus location with ease.
Department: Whether they choose from a list or enter their department, it's all covered.
Age: Students can conveniently provide their age for record-keeping purposes.
Input Validation
Our system takes data integrity and accuracy seriously. We've implemented robust input validation to ensure the information collected is top-notch. Here's what we've got:

Username Validation: No empty fields allowed! We'll flag the username field if it's left blank.
Campus Validation: We double-check the campus field to eliminate any potential errors.
Department Validation: Data quality is crucial, and our system ensures that the department field is correctly filled.
Age Validation: We've added a nifty feature â€“ the background color of the age field turns yellow if a student's age is less than 20 and red if it's an invalid entry.
Reset and Submit Buttons
We've made life easy with two buttons at the bottom of the form:

Reset: Clicking this button clears the form, so you can start fresh.
Submit: When you click this button, it initiates the "CheckForm" function, which can perform various tasks like data processing, storage, or submission, depending on your specific needs.
